### MovieRadar App
MovieRadar is a full-stack web application offering two user roles: admin and regular user.
Regular users can browse the movie catalog, filter and sort movies, explore movie details, and engage with the community by leaving ratings and reviews. Admins have extended privileges, allowing them to manage the movie database by adding, editing, or removing movies.

This project was developed by a team of four. Beyond just coding, this was a great opportunity to improve our teamwork and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to work under pressure. Our main focus was to build a fully functional system while refining the way the frontend and backend communicate. 

### Key Features
<li>Frontend Modularity: Modular JavaScript structure for better maintainability.</li>
<li>Asynchronous Operations: Backend and frontend efficiently handle async requests for a smooth user experience.</li>
<li>Controllers & Endpoints: Well-structured controllers for handling API requests.</li>
<li>Token & Cookie-based Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>Four-layer Architecture: Clear separation of concerns with Application, WebAPI, Infrastructure, and Domain layers.</li>
<li>Version Control: Git and GitHub used for collaborative development and code management.</li>

### Technologies used
**Backend**: Supabase, Visual Studio, ASP.NET Core, C#, Dapper, Mediator, Four-layer architecture (Application, WebAPI, Infrastructure, Domain)

**Frontend**: Visual Studio Code, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

**Tools & Services**: Git, GitHub, Postman, Cloudinary
